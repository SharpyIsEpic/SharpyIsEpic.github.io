	<h1>You are next</h1>
	<p>As you're reading this, you may feel a cold shiver run down your spine. You don't know why, but you feel like you're being watched. You're not alone. You've never been alone. There's someone out there, waiting for their chance to strike. And now, that chance has come. You are next.</p>
	<p>You may try to run, to hide, to deny it. But it won't change a thing. Your fate has already been decided. You are next.</p>
